    "For getting a concrete idea about the problem begin by having a quick look at Chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto's book on RL: http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf. In summary, the two core concepts that this algorithm drives through are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a hypothetical setting where you are repeatedly faced with making a choice from **k** different options (each with\n",
    "different reward amounts), how do you choose the *one* sweet option everytime so that you maximize your reward over a period of time? \n",
    "2. Along the course of your learning the best possible action, how do you balance between **exploiting** what you have       learned so far (i.e. choosing the best action from your current reward value estimation of the k actions) and **exploring** what you may not have learned yet (with the gamble that it may improve your current estimates of rewards and 'open up new avenues')? Sounds philosophical eh?\n",

That's an irony! So lets be practical and iterate through a finite number of steps so that we can finish the homework before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So in each step of your *for* loop you do the following:\n",
    "        a. Be greedy: choose the action for which you get the best estimated reward (Hint: use the vector Q to do this).\n",
    "        b. Do you have a tie for the best action in the step a? Then be fair and break the tie randomly.\n",
    "        c. Take the step in the environment and collect your reward. (You know how to do this right? Hint: Scroll up)\n",
    "        d. Update the step count for the action you just took (Hint: use the vector N to do this).\n",
    "        e. Now the crux of the algorithm, the one key line that defines it all...update your reward estimate as:\n",
    "           Q[action_you_took] = Q[action_you_took] + (1/N[action_you_took]) * (reward - Q[action_you_took])\n",
    "        f. As always don't forget to check the status of DONE! Or else your bot is doomed for eternity...\n",
    "Your homework code requires you to do one additional thing. You need to record the mean reward every **(s = floor(steps / 100))** step. There are number of ways you could do that easily. One simple way is to keep a separate varaible **reward_record** to sum succesive rewards you get each step till you encounter **mod(i/s) == 0** where **i** is your *for* loop counter. At this point you store the amount of summed up reward so far (after dividing it by **s**) and reset **reward_record** to zero.\n",

    "2. Wait. Where does **epsilon** come into all this? Your hunch was right...the other core concept of this algorithm: *To explore or to exploit...thats the question.* How do you decide? You don't. You just let *the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune* do it for you. Humor apart, **epsilon** (value ranging from 0-1) is the probability that your bot will not be greedy. So in the step **a** of the pseudocode above, instead of choosing the action with the current maximum estimated reward everytime, you choose an action randomly from all available actions with **epsilon** probability (yes by doing so you also give the action with maximum reward a fair chance of getting chosen after all...so democratic!).

    "### Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As earlier, begin by giving Sutton and Barto's book on temporal difference learning a quick read (Chapter 6). Temporal difference is a class of a number of algorithms of which Q-learning is a member. Why they are called 'temporal difference' learners is based on the reward updation step as you shall see soon (step 5 of *fit* function below). For the purposes of completing the code, here is what you need to know:\n",
    "1. Now you can no longer assume that there is only one state in your environment. Refer to the Frozen Lake problem above for an example. Every action takes you to a new state where taking the same action as in the previous state does not necessarily elicit the same reward. So instead of considering actions alone, you need to consider (state,action) pairs. Thats the key concept.\n",
    "2. There is a difference in the reward learning step...we will deal with that in a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets dive in:\n",
    "This time your *fit* function has access to 2 additional parameters, **discount** and **adaptive**. You will soon see how we will use these in our code...\n",
    "as in MAB, begin by setting up the following two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q = a matrix to store the current reward estimate for each possible state-action pair (all zeros at the beginning).\n",
    "\n",
    "N = a matrix to store the number of steps taken for each possible state-action pair (all zeros at the beginning).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if A is the number of possible actions, and S is the number of possible states in the environment, each of the above two matrcies should be of size (S,A). By now you surely know how to get S and A right?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>ATTENTION:</b> As always, rememeber to press the RESET button at the beginning!\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for the *for* loop its pretty much the same game as in MAB (except for a few subtle differences as you will see):\n",
    "1. As in MAB be (1 - epsilon)% greedy and epsilon% non-greedy in choosing your action. Only this time be wary of the state you are currently in i.e. best action is the action with the maximum estimated reward for the current state. (Hint: use the matrix Q). \n",
    "2. Do you have a tie for the best action in step 1? Then be fair and break the tie randomly.\n",
    "3. Take the step in the environment and collect your reward. Also record the **state_after_action** your bot enters as a result of taking the action. (You know how to do this right? Hint: Scroll up)\n",
    "4. Update your step count for the action you just took. Again, be wary of the state you are in. (Hint: use the matrix N)\n",
    "5. Now the crux of the algorithm, the subtle difference from MAB...update your reward estimate as:\n",
    "*Q[state_before_action, current_action] = Q[state_before_action, current_action] + (1.0 / N[state_before_action, current_action]) x (reward + **discount** x max(Q[state_after_action,:]) - Q[state_before_action, current_action])*. Very carefully note how we use the the *state before the current action* i.e. the **state from the previous iteration** and the *state after taking the current action* i.e. the **state you enter in the current iteration after performing the action**. Note how the reward updation is based on an error value measuring the difference in the estimate for the current step as compared to the previous step. Hence the name *temporal difference*.\n",
    "6. Update the **state_before_action** using: **state_before_action = state_after_action**.\n",
    "6. As always don't ignore DONE! Or else...\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>SUBTLETY ALERT:</b> What state is your bot at the beginning of the game? Hint: Did you press the RESET button at the beginning?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah yes, your homework requires you to record the mean reward every **(s = floor(steps / 100))** step. Follow the same lead as in MAB...\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, lets deal with **adaptive**. So you can rely on the *augur* (read *np.random.choice*) to decide when to **explore**  and when to **exploit**. But hey! Thats what the medieval people did right? So as society evolved it became self-reliant and learned to trust its own experiences in deciding things rather than resort to fantasy. Likewise, as your bot gains experience in the environment with increasing number of steps it takes, the estimates for the rewards for (state,action) pairs get better and better. So the strategy is to gradually shift from epsilon% exploration (and consequently [1 - epsilon]% exploitation) to 100% exploitation since you know your estimates are as good as it can get in finite time. One systematic way to do this is to introduce a hyper-parameter **progress** which is simply how many steps your bot has taken so far (as a fraction of the maximum number of steps it is supposed to take). For your convenience, your script has been set-up so that **progress** based **epsilon** is obtained simply by calling the function *_get_epsilon(**progress**)*. So in step 1 of the the Q-learning *fit* function, for every iteration, you always use the **epsilon** valued obtained from *_get_epsilon(**progress**)* where **progress** = i / steps (assuming *i* is your *for* loop counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at this stage, *predict* is an absolute no-brainer for you. As you guessed its the same as in MAB. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>SUBTLETY ALERT:</b> When predicting in Q-learning, remember that the action that yields the maximum reward depends on the current state. Hint: use the fitted Q matrix for this.\n",
